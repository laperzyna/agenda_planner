# Work Day Scheduler
## Main
This program is a work day scheduler. It is an agenda that runs from 9am to 5pm, business hours. It presents the current date at the top of the display and highlights each hour based on whether that hour lies in the past, present, or future. The user is able to write into the box and as they save their event is set in local storage.

## What I Struggled With
This program took me quite a while to get as far as I did and I'm pretty happy with how it looks. I was struggling for a long time just trying to understand jQuery and the fontawesome stuff but at the same time I was able to discover some pretty cool things like icon animations. The one thing that I struggled with the most and could not get was my program to be able to show the events that the user had written in once the page was refreshed. I was able to commit their events to the local storage but couldn't pull them onto the page after the refresh. I'm not sure why. I was playing with JSON parse and stringify but I really just have no ideas on how to fix that part. It had me stumped for a good few hours.
